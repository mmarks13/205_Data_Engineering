For this question I used the following measures:

Door to diagnostic eval - OP_20
Percent of newborns whose deliveries were scheduled early (1-3 weeks early), when a scheduled delivery was not medically necessary - PC_01
Hospital acquired potentially preventable venous thromboembolism - VTE_6
Rate of readmission after discharge from hospital (hospital-wide) - READM_30_HOSP_WIDE


I felt that these described a wide variety of quality aspects in a minimal number of measures. This was simply based on my experience as a healthcare consultant.  

To turn these into a single quality measure, I simple transformed them into z-scores and then averaged the four measures for each hospital. Since they are all measures in which higher is worse, the lowest average z-score was determined to have the highest quality. 

Hospitals were only included in my rankings if they had all four measures. 

This all assumes the measures are normally distrubuted. 

The output table is in the following HDFS directory:
