You unfortunately won't be able to run my code. However, I have included the following files:

1) Final_Presentation.pdf - Made additions to this since the presentation was given. 
2) ETL_Package.xml - the ETL package that is used by SSIS. It contains the .NET code used for cleaning as well. 
3) Hospital_Compare_Database_Backup.zip - a SQL Server backup of the database generated by the ETL package. 
4) Dashboard.twb - the tableau workbook used to generate the dashboard. 

The dashboard can be seen at this link.

Thanks for everything over the last two semesters. I appreciate your patience. I definitely feel like I ended up getting what I needed out of the course. Good luck with the course in the future. If you ever want any more feedback, don't hesitate to reach out.
