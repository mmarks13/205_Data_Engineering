For this question I used the following measures:

Door to diagnostic eval - OP_20
Percent of newborns whose deliveries were scheduled early (1-3 weeks early), when a scheduled delivery was not medically necessary - PC_01
Hospital acquired potentially preventable venous thromboembolism - VTE_6
Rate of readmission after discharge from hospital (hospital-wide) - READM_30_HOSP_WIDE


I felt that these described a wide variety of quality aspects based on my experience as a healthcare consultant.  

To turn these into a single quality measure, I simple transformed them into z-scores and then 

The output table is in the following HDFS directory:
