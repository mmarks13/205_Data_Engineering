For this question I used all measures from tbl_effective_care. I simply aggregated all of them across each hospital to get a mean and standard deviation for each hospital. I grouped by hospital first to ensure that each hospital only had one of each measure. 

To determine the variability, I calculated a coefficient of variation so measure variability could be compared despite differing units. 

The output table is in the following HDFS directory:
/user/w205/hospital_compare_INVESTIGATIONS/best_states/
